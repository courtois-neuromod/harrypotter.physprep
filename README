# Courtois-NeuroMod: [Harrypotter subdataset, physpprep derivatives](https://github.com/courtois-neuromod/harrypotter.physprep) 

The [Courtois project on Neural Modelling (Courtois NeuroMod)](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) aims at training artificial neural networks using extensive experimental data on individual human brain activity and behaviour.

Participants performed task xxx while functional data being acquired in the MRI scanner . A extensive description can be found [here](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/DATASETS.html#harrypotter).

This subdataset is organized following the [brain imaging data structure (BIDS)](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) (including extensions in development) and contains:
- [ ] [preprocessed neuroimaging data](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/DERIVATIVES.html#fmriprep)
- [ ] behavioral variables in event files
- [x] preprocessed physiological data

*(unchecked are collected data which have not yet been integrated in the dataset)*

Courtois NeuroMod data are [freely shared with the scientific community](https://docs.cneuromod.ca/en/latest/ACCESS.html) to advance research at the interface of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Access to to the data is based on a registered access model, see the Courtois NeuroMod website for more information. Redistribution of data outside of the Courtois NeuroMod data bank is prohibited.
